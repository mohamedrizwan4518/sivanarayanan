Project Title: Responsive Website Design for Tech Startup
Project Overview:
I designed a responsive website for a tech startup that specializes in cloud computing solutions. The goal was to create a modern, clean, and user-friendly website that highlights the company’s services, showcases case studies, and drives user engagement through calls to action (CTAs).

Technologies Used:
Design Tools: Figma, Adobe XD
Front-End Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Framework: Bootstrap
Animations: CSS3 Animations, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
Design Goals:
Create a clean, modern, and professional look to align with the startup’s brand.
Ensure the website is mobile-first and provides a seamless experience across all devices.
Highlight core services and case studies to build credibility and attract new clients.
Incorporate subtle animations to enhance the user experience without overwhelming the content.
Development Process:
1. Research & Discovery:
I began by conducting research on the startup’s competitors and target audience to better understand the design direction that would resonate with their users.
I worked closely with the client to identify key sections for the website, including home, services, case studies, and contact.
The main focus was to create a clean and professional look that would build trust and highlight the company’s expertise.
2. Wireframing & Prototyping:
Created low-fidelity wireframes to define the structure and layout of the website. This ensured that the content was organized in a way that was both visually appealing and easy to navigate.
Used Figma to create high-fidelity prototypes, focusing on the user journey, and ensuring that important sections like the services and CTA buttons were prominently displayed.
Prototyped different layouts to test how the design would perform across various screen sizes, ensuring a mobile-first approach.
3. Visual Design:
Selected a minimal color palette featuring shades of blue and white to evoke professionalism and trust.
Used sans-serif fonts to maintain a modern and clean appearance, with clear visual hierarchy across headings, body text, and buttons.
Designed custom iconography to represent the tech services offered, ensuring consistency with the startup’s branding.
Added illustrations and images that are relevant to the tech industry to create visual interest and break up text-heavy sections.
4. Front-End Development:
Built the website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with a mobile-first design approach.
Integrated Bootstrap to ensure responsive layouts, grids, and components that adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.
Used GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to add subtle animations, such as smooth scrolling, hover effects on buttons, and fade-in effects for images and text as users scroll down the page.
Implemented CSS transitions for interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links) to improve user engagement and create a polished, dynamic experience.
5. Performance Optimization:
Minimized image sizes and compressed assets to ensure fast load times.
Used lazy loading for images and other media to optimize page performance.
Ensured the website passed Google’s Core Web Vitals with high scores, focusing on performance, accessibility, and best practices.
6. User Testing:
Conducted user testing sessions with a small group of the startup’s target users to gather feedback on the design, navigation, and content clarity.
Iterated on the design based on feedback, making adjustments to the navigation menu and refining the CTA placements to increase conversions.
Final Outcome:
The website was successfully launched, and the client saw an increase in user engagement and inquiries through the contact form. The clean, professional design helped establish the startup as a trustworthy and credible company in the tech industry.

Client Feedback: "The website has exceeded our expectations in terms of both design and functionality. The responsive layout ensures that our visitors get a great experience whether they’re on mobile or desktop, and the animations add a polished touch."
