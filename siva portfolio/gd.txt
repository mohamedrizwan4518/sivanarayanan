Design Process:
1. Research & Discovery:
I started by researching the cafe’s target audience and competitors to understand the visual landscape in the coffee industry. This helped me identify the elements that would differentiate XYZ Cafe.

Target Audience: Young professionals aged 25-40, tech-savvy, trend-conscious.
Brand Values: Quality, innovation, community, and eco-friendliness.
2. Mood Board & Inspiration:
I created a mood board based on modern, minimalistic styles with clean typography, earthy tones, and a focus on typography-driven design. I drew inspiration from cafes with a similar vibe, taking into account the cafe’s urban location and eco-friendly approach.

3. Logo Design:
For the logo, I focused on a clean, geometric design that represents the cafe's focus on quality and simplicity. The mark incorporates a stylized coffee cup within a minimalist circular form, emphasizing the brand's modernity.

Typography: Chose a modern sans-serif font for a sleek, contemporary feel.
Color Palette: Earth tones like dark brown, beige, and cream, reflecting warmth and organic quality.
Logo Variations: Provided versions for print, web, and merchandise applications.
4. Packaging Design:
The packaging design reflects the brand's minimalism while ensuring functionality. The use of eco-friendly materials was important to the client, so I integrated these into the packaging design for coffee cups, bags, and napkins.

Design Focus: Clear, easy-to-read typography with the logo at the center.
Materials: Recycled kraft paper and biodegradable plastic alternatives.
5. Menu Design:
The menu design used a simple grid layout with bold headers to maintain clarity. I used high-contrast typography with elegant fonts that match the brand’s minimalist aesthetic.

Menu Layout: Single-page design with visually distinct categories and iconography.
Color Usage: Black and beige, ensuring readability and alignment with the cafe’s interior aesthetic.
6. Social Media Graphics:
I designed a series of Instagram posts and stories to highlight the cafe's offerings, focusing on visually appealing photography paired with branded graphics.

Post Themes: New product launches, promotions, community events.
Visual Elements: The logo, color palette, and typography are consistently applied to ensure brand recognition.
Final Outcome:
The project resulted in a cohesive visual identity that successfully communicates XYZ Cafe’s modern, eco-friendly brand. The client reported increased brand recognition and positive feedback on the packaging and social media posts.
